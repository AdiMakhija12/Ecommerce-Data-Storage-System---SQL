This project involves creating a database for an e-commerce system using MySQL, focusing on data modeling and CRUD operations. It includes tables for users, products, and orders, with user data distinguishing between customers and vendors. The project requires setting up these tables, populating them with data from CSV files, and implementing functions for inserting and selecting records. Advanced tasks include querying for statistical insights, such as maximum and minimum order values, and creating a customer leaderboard based on purchase history. The primary goal is to practice database interactions and data manipulation using Python.
